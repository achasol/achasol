### Hi there 👋

I'm Naim, I work as a freelance machine learning engineer in the Netherlands.
I am fortunate to have worked on many interesting projects for a diverse set of companies. 


My current areas of interest are: 

- Causal ML (the why)
- Non-linear & stochastic optimization (the how) 
- Timeseries forecasting (the when) 


Want to have a chat? reach out to me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/na%C3%AFm-achahboun-b0b50a196),
or send me an email on [naim@achasol.com](mailto:naim@achasol.com)

### Open source work 👍
- [functime.ai](https://functime.ai/) - added several feature extraction methods for timeseries using Polars.
